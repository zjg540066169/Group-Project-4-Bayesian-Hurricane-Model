# Hurrican Data
hurrican356.csv collected the track data of 356 hurricanes in  the North Atlantic area since 1989. For all the storms, their location (longitude \& latitude) and maximum wind speed were recorded every 6 hours. The data includes the following variables 

1. **ID**:  ID of the hurricans
2. **Season**: In which \textbf{year} the hurricane occurred 
3. **Month**: In which \textbf{month} the hurricane occurred 
4. **Nature**:  Nature of the hurricane 
  + ET: Extra Tropical
  + DS: Disturbance
  + NR: Not Rated
  + SS: Sub Tropical
  + TS: Tropical Storm
5. **time**: dates and time of the record  
6. **Latitude** and **Longitude**:  The location of  a hurricane check point 
7. **Wind.kt**  Maximum wind speed (in Knot) at each check point

# A Bayesian model for hurricane trajectories. 

Climate researchers are interested in modeling the hurricane trajectories. Let $t$ be time (in hours) since a hurricane began, and For each hurrican $i$, we denote 
$\{ Y_{i,1}(t), Y_{i,2}(t), Y_{i,3}(t)\},j=1,2,3$ be the latitude, longitude, and wind speed at time $t$. The following Baysian model was suggested.

$$Y_{i,j}(t+6) =  \mu_{i,j}(t) +\rho_jY_{i,j}(t) + \epsilon_{i,j}(t)$$
where $\mu_{i,j}(t)$ is the funtional mean, and the errors $(\epsilon_{i,1}(t),\epsilon_{i,2}(t),\epsilon_{i,3}(t))$ follows a multivariate normal distributions with mean zero and covariance matrix $\Sigma$, independent across $t$. We further assume that the mean functions $\mu_{i,j}(t)$ can be written as
$$\mu_{i,j}(t) =  \beta_{0,j}+x_{i,1}(t)\beta_{1,j} +
x_{i,2} \beta_{2,j} + x_{i,3}\beta_{3,j} +
\sum_{k=1}^3\beta_{3+k,j}\Delta_{i,k}(t-6)
$$ where
$x_{i,1}(t)$, ranging from 0 to 365, is the day of year at time $t$, $x_{i,2}$ is the calenda year of the hurrican, and $x_{i,3}$ is the type of hurrican, 
and
$$\Delta_{i,k}(t-6) = Y_{i,k}(t) -Y_{i,k}(t-6),k=1,2,3$$
are the change of latitude, longitude, and wind speed
between $t-6$ and $t$.

\paragraph{Prior distributions}

We assume the following prior distributions


For $\boldsymbol{\beta}=(\beta_{k,j})_{k=0,...,6, j=1,2,3}$, we assume
$\pi(\boldsymbol{\beta})$ is jointly normal with mean 0 and variance $diag(1, p)$. 

We assume that $\pi(\rho_j)$ follows a trucated normal  $N_{[0,1]}(0.5, 1/5)$ 
 
 $\pi(\Sigma^{-1})$ follows a $Wishart (3, diag(0.1,3))$



# A Simplified Bayesian model for hurricane trajectories. 

Let $t$ be time (in hours) since a hurricane began, and For each hurrican $i$, we denote 
$Y_{i}(t)$ be the wind speed at time $t$. The following Baysian model was suggested.

$$Y_{i}(t+6) =  \mu_{i}(t) +\rho_jY_{i}(t) + \epsilon_{i}(t)$$
where $\mu_{i}(t)$ is the funtional mean, and the errors $\epsilon_{i}(t)$ follows a  normal distributions with mean zero and variance $\sigma^2$, independent across $t$. 

We further assume that the mean functions $\mu_{i}(t)$ can be written as
$$\mu_{i}(t) =  \beta_{0}+x_{i,1}(t)\beta_{1} +
x_{i,2} \beta_{2} + x_{i,3}\beta_{3} +
\sum_{k=1}^3\beta_{3+k}\Delta_{i,k}(t-6)
$$ where
$x_{i,1}(t)$, ranging from 0 to 365, is the day of year at time $t$, $x_{i,2}$ is the calenda year of the hurrican, and $x_{i,3}$ is the type of hurrican, 
and
$$\Delta_{i,k}(t-6) = Y_{i,k}(t) -Y_{i,k}(t-6),k=1,2,3$$
are the change of latitude, longitude, and wind speed
between $t-6$ and $t$.


\paragraph{Prior distributions}

We assume the following prior distributions


For $\boldsymbol{\beta}=(\beta_{k})_{k=0,...,6}$, we assume
$\pi(\boldsymbol{\beta})$ is jointly normal with mean 0 and variance $diag(1, p)$. 

We assume that $\pi(\rho)$ follows a trucated normal  $N_{[0,1]}(0.5, 1/5)$ 
 
 $\pi(\Sigma^{-1})$ follows a inverse-gamma $(0.001, 0.001)$


# Choose either the full model or simplied model, and complete the following  tasks:



Randomly select 80\% hurricanes and design a MCMC algorithm to estiamte the posterior distributions of the model parameters. Estimate the model parameters using posteri means and  construct their 95% credibility intervals; What we learn from the models? 


Apply your model you developped to track the remaining 20\% hurricans, and evaluate how well your model could predict and track these hurricanes. 



Write a summary statement of  your findings and comment on the proposed baysian model.
